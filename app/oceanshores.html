          <h1>Our Beach House</h1>
          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Our cozy beach cabin in Ocean Shores is not fancy but it's clean and
            well-maintained. We go down several times a year for a nice
            relaxing vacation or a weekend.</p>
            <img class="os-img os-ctr" src="assets/images/oceanShores/osHouseFront.png"/>
            <p>It's an easy 10 minute walk to the beach which
            is a four-mile long unbroken stretch of sand.  Clamming is a popular
            activity on several weekends each year, and on July 4th 10,000 people fill
            the beach with fireworks and bonfires. Cars are allowed to drive on certain
            parts of the beach.  It's not very interesting for beachcombers most of the
            time although you can occasionally find sand dollars, and after a good storm
            some floats might wash up.
            <img class="os-img os-right" src="assets/images/oceanShores/IMG_2747.JPG"/>
          </p>
          <p>Deer often walk through the yard and can be seen all around the
            neighborhood. There is a swimming pool nearby, and we have plenty of
          outdoor toys and games for the yard or the beach.  We also have a canoe
           and there is a cool lake in the middle of the town for paddling.</p>
          <p>Building a fire in the front yard fire pit is a favorite thing to do
          in the evenings, or you can also have a bonfire on the beach.</p>
          <p>We have a game room with pool, foosball, darts and air hockey in the garage,
            and many games in the game closet, so there is a lot to do on rainy days too.</p>
          <p>Be sure to check out the mural in the game room by famous artist
            <a href="http://rosieheffernan.com">Rosie Heffernan</a>
          painted (with help from her little sisters) when she was 14 years old.</p>
          <h2>Accommodation</h2>
          <p>The house sleeps a lot of people.  There are beds for 9, plus two folding
            army cots and a queen-size blow-up mattress.  There are also couches and
            lots of floor space.</p>
          <img class="os-img os-left" src="assets/images/oceanShores/IMG_2746.JPG"/>
          <p>There are two bathrooms but only one shower so short showers are a must if there
          are a lot of people staying.  Adding a full bathroom upstairs is on our to-do list.</p>
          <p>The fully-equipped kitchen and several tables with 12 chairs (including 4 folding
            chairs) mean that large groups can eat meals together.  We like to have
          big family gatherings there.</p>
          <h2>Activities</h2>
          <p>There are a lot of fun things to do in Ocean Shores besides hang out at the
            beach, and we are never bored. Check out what's happening at the
            convention center the week you are there, or see if Galway bay has
            some live music. There are a variety of cute galleries and gift shops
            scattered throughout the town, as well as interesting restaurants
            and fun divey bars.
          </p>

          <p>We hope your stay is enjoyable, and that you love our cute cabin as much
          as we do!</p>
